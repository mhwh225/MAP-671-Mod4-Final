### Source

All Hydrology data was retrived from USGS, the United States Geological Survey, who provide all sorts of free natural science GIS datasets. (*https://www.usgs.gov/*) DEM retrived from the Kentucky Geography Network (*kyraster.ky.gov*) Map Compiled by M.H.Whitlock in 2024 (mhwh225@uky.edu)

### Why this map was made 

To gain a better understanding of how kentucky's watersheds work and how they overlap with nearby watersheds.

### How this map was made

Firstly I decided to cover the HU2 Ohio Region Watershed since it makes up the vast majority of kentucky's total watershed coverage. What a watershed is, is a area of land where all the water flows down to one point. for example the HU2 Ohio Reigon Watershed all flows southwest to the HU4 Lower Ohio Watershed into the missispi river. Watersheds are made up of smaller watershed with the biggest being HU2's that get divided smaller and smaller untill waterflow can't be further divided. This map shows down to the HU6 level which can be seen dividing the some of the larger watersheds with a thin gray line. data in avalible for smaller watersheds like HU8s or even HU12s buT they become difficult to make out at this scale. For my map I decided that I would put an basemap of the HU2-HU6 Watersheds of the Ohio Region with an overlay of the outline of kentucky to give a sense of visual scale to the map and help people understand the true size of these watersheds. to recreate this map you need only to the link above find their interactive hydrology map download the desired watershed data. Then decide the minimum size watershed you want to look at, and make it your basemap by giving it some color and opacity to put an elevation map under. Then layer only the borders of the larger watersheds on top at which point you can add labels, some smaller watersheds like you see in Wabash and Upper Ohio, or a state of your choice for scale.

### Projection

the original data was mostly just several layers made of ploygons outlining the area of the varrious levels of watershed. After creating the map most of the sections that where to small to make much sense of, HU12,  were discarded and the larger watersheds like HU4 and HU2 were made clear so they could be overlaid on top of the HU6 layer to better show how the layers fit together.
